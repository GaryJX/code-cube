<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About This Project

Code Cube is an online frontâ€‘end development live code editor for prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Authentication is implemented using GitHub and Google OAuth providers. View live demo at <a href="https://code-cube.garyxie.me/" target="_blank">code-cube.garyxie.me</a>.

#### Built With

- Go
- MongoDB
- React
- TypeScript
- Next.js

## Future Enhancements Roadmap

- [ ] Add real-time live code updates with WebSockets
- [ ] Allow user to invite other users to cubes in order to allow for collaboration
- [ ] Allow user to configure adding JavaScript packages from a CDN (e.g. CDNjs, Unpkg)
- [ ] Create a landing page to showcase the application's features, instead of immediately redirecting user to Login page
- [ ] Add a Grid view for viewing cubes, including a screenshot of the project for better UX
<!-- - [ ] Look into using Quill.js + Highlight.js for Deltas (to improve functionality for realtime collaboration changes)
- [ ] Replace Auth solution from Next-Auth to Go solution (so that auth is handled in the same server as the backend server) -->

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

#### Installation and Set Up

1.  Clone the repository.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/GaryJX/code-cube.git
    ```
2.  `cd` into the `client` directory.
    ```sh
    cd code-cube/client
    ```
3.  Install client dependencies.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  Create `.env.local` by copying the template file `.env.sample`.
    ```sh
    cp .env.sample .env.local
    ```
5.  Update your `.env.local` file with environment variables

    ```
    # .env.local

    NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
    NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:8080

    # Optional parameters for setting up OAuth authentation and saving sessions to DB
    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
    GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
    MONGODB_URI=
    MONGODB_DB=
    ```

6.  Start the front-end development server.
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
7.  Try out the guest editor at http://localhost:3000/editor/guest.
    <br>
8.  In a new terminal, `cd` into the `server` directory.
    ```sh
    cd server
    ```
9.  Install server dependencies.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
10. Create `.env` by copying the template file `.env.sample`.

    ```sh
    cp .env.sample .env
    ```

11. Update your `.env` file with environment variables.

    ```
    # .env

    CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
    DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
    DB_NAME=codeCube
    ```

12. Start the back-end development server.

    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```

#### Production Deployment

- The `client` folder containing the front-end code is hosted on [Vercel](vercel.com), and is automatically rebuilt whenever a commit is pushed to the `main` branch
- The `server` folder containing the server-side code is hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/). To trigger a re-deployment, push the changes to Heroku's remote Git repository:

  ```sh
  git subtree push --prefix server heroku main
  ```

<!-- ## Routes

#### Frontend

- Login: `/login`
  - Centered modal form to allow the user to log in/register (with OAuth providers or Email?)
  - Redirects to `/` if user is already logged in
- Homepage: `/`
  - Shows the index page, containing a list of Code Cubes that the user is created, and they can add/delete cubes here
  - Redirects to `/login` if user is not logged in
- Editor: `/editor/<id>`
  - The main editor page, allowing the user to edit the HTML/CSS/JS of the cube and see the rendered page.
  - Also see if I can allow importing packages from `cdnjs`, `unpkg`, or `jsdelivr`
  - Redirects to `/login` if user is not logged in
- (Lower Priority) Landing Page: `/<todo: replace Homepage with another endpoint>`
  - A landing page to display the functionality of the application

#### Backend

- Cubes List: `/api/cubes` (GET)
  - Gets a list of the all of the cubes available to the user
- Create New Cube: `/api/cube` (POST)
- Get Cube: `/api/cube/<id>` (GET)
  - TODO: Change this endpoint to a WebSocket connection instead
- Edit Cube: `/api/cube/<id>` (PUT)
  - TODO: Change this to a PATCH method instead to allow for incremental and separate changes to HTML, CSS, JS, and packages
- Delete Cube: `/api/cube` (DELETE) -->
